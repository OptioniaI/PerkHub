Script:

`_G.DTC = true -- | Must keep on true to make sure you don't crash.`

`_G.IGR = true -- | Can turn off to fix certain bugs with the script, but may not work sometimes.`

`_G.ADTC = true -- | Recommended to keep on as only for public servers to detect if a staff joins. (Developers, Admins, and Mods) -- But it is your choice if you want to get banned.`
